## Introduction
  This is an implementation of "SENSOR BASED ON-STREET PARKING SPACE STATUS INFERENCE UPON A SEMI-SUPERVISED AND MULTI-TASK LEARNING NETWORK" in TensorFlow for parking slots status inference

# Training:
	1. In current version, the mode training with {EntropyLoss|FocalLossV1}, and I do not use maxout.

# Experiment:
    -

# Evaluation:
	-

# You should have this tree structure in the current folder:
